// one of the most important topics in js is DOM:-The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document

// Lets take an example suppose there is a h1 elements in html file and you want to fetch that h1 elemnts from html to js



var a=document.querySelector("h1") //you can write in this way or like line number 12
a.innerHTML="helllo everyone"
a.style.color="red"

document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML="hello guys"
